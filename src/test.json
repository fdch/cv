                    "narrative": "Distinguishing interpretational styles of a musical work is an important step in the field of musical performance analysis. This study investigates similarities and differences across performances of the Aria and Aria da Capo in J.S. Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations. Supervised machine learning techniques\u2014including support vector machine with L1 regularization, na\u00efve Bayes, and gradient boosting regression\u2014were used to assess classification accuracy of the performer of the Aria da Capo from the Aria training set, as well as to discern relative feature importance. For each recording, MIDI-audio alignment was conducted in order to estimate onset and offset times for each note in the audio files, allowing the musical score to be matched with each individual performances. Using statements by performers and theorists as a guideline, the musical score was analyzed in order to select specific performance features that were likely to contribute to the overall musical character and emotional impact of the twin arias (Booth, 2014; Denk 2012; Huizenga, 2012; Schenkman, 1975). Therefore, in addition to general performance features (e.g., overall tempo, pulse clarity, spectral flatness), music theory-driven interpretational features were also assessed (e.g., ornamentation, articulation, and rubato in areas of structural importance in the musical score; emphasis in ground bass \u201cmotifs\u201d across the four quatrains). Along with studies of perceived and experienced emotion in response to the Goldberg Variations (e.g., Fabian & Schubert, 2003; Gotlieb & Konec\u030cni, 1985), this project contributes to discussions regarding how musical performances can lead to moments of power in Bach\u2019s music.",

Further, this expression of the self is neither centered on the human par- ticipant nor on the socially constructed notions of the self, but on nonhuman aspects such as the reflection and capture of light, or the technological array of the installation as such.

Likewise, the spatialization paradigm that has governed most electronic music continues to be stereo, with the use of diffusion or ambisonics as last resort spatialization techniques. Emphasizing the importance of space, this paper describes the design of a real-time computer music piece called Lorenz Variations, written directly for high density loudspeaker arrays (HDLAs) of variable lengths. In using point-source location techniques and vector-based amplitude panning (VBAP) as composing tools instead of spatialization tools, I argue that space is not just a musical parameter but a compositional source that expands our listening experience into yet unknown dimensions, and it is our duty to explore the many aesthetic potentials it advances..

I place my dissertation in relation to existing scholarship, artists, and developers working in the fields of music composition, computer science, affect, and ontology, with emphasis on the ubiquity of databases and on the need to reflect on their practice, particularly in relation to databasing and music composition. There is a database everywhere, anytime, always already affecting our lives; it is an agent in our aesthetic and political lives just as much as we are agents in its composition and performance. Database music lives in between computers and sound. My argument is that in order to conceptualize the agency of the database in music composition, we need to trace the history of the practice, in both its technical and its artistic use, so as to find nodes of action that have an effect on the resulting aesthetics. Therefore, this dissertation is composed of two main sections. In the first part, I trace a history of database practices from three points of view. The first is from new media theory, emphasizing the intersection between the database and the body. The second is from the history of the database in computer science, giving a panoramic view of the tools and concepts behind database systems, models, structures. The third is from their use in sound practices, describing different approaches to databasing from the fields of music information retrieval, sonification, and computer music. In the second part, I discuss the agency of the database under the broader concepts of sound, self, and community. These three axes are addressed in four sections, each with a different perspective. First I focus on listening and present the database as a resonant subject in a networked relation and community with the human. Second, I focus on memory, comparing human memory and writing with digital information storing, thus relating databasing and composition with memory, archives, and their spectrality. Third, I analyze the performativity of databasing, understanding the database as gendered, in its temporality, repetition, and in its contingent appearance as style, skin, and timbre. In the last section, I revise the notion of music work, reflecting on the consequences of the anarchic and the inoperative in the community of database music. As an appendix, I present an open-source library for making and performing a multimodal database that combines computer vision and timbre analysis algorithms to generate a database of image and audio descriptors suitable for automated navigation, querying, and live audio-visual performance.",

                    "narrative": "The practice of composition takes place from the most distant memory of sound to the intimacy of perceivable waves. For music to emerge from these waves, two negative processes need to take place, relating to consciousness, memory, and difference. These constitute the possibility condition of what I call the unveiling, staging, and unworking of the music object. From this rethinking of the composition practice, how does identity emerge from this precondition of difference? This is how the database enters into this framing of the practice of composition. Drawing from Derrida\u2019s conceptualization of the archive, I find the \u2018archontic\u2019 principle embedded within the structural quality of the database, and emerging through its performance. The computer is a multitude of databases constantly projecting their authority, their archontic power onto their users. Thus, in the same way the written word becomes the rule, just as the structured data prescribes its command, the severed object of music emerges as style, order, or identity. The question is, however, how can we conceive the aesthetic experience without this authoritative character; without this inherent imposition of order and identity? The space is opened, thus, for the concept of an anarchic unwork of art.",

In other words, since musicians cannot meet in the same room to play music with each other, they have learned to move their musical performance to the network.  We argue that this translation can be thought of as a new opportunity to rethink music and music performance research, considering the network as a new performative space. As a case study, we present a \"1002\", a collaborative networked performance created using a custom software called \"CollidePd\". \"1002\" is an invitation to anonymous collaboration in real time with remote performers, without any required musical training. The sonic research of this performance is based on the sonification of the musical gesture mediated by the mobile device, emphasizing the participatory movement of the performers. ",
