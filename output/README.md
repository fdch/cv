# POST-DOCTORAL EXPERIENCE

**Ohio State University**, Columbus, OH  
Postdoctoral Scholar in Immersive Audio at the Advanced Computing Center
for the Arts and Design (2019-2021)

# EDUCATION

**New York University**, New York, NY  
PhD in Music Composition and Theory, May 2019

**Universidad Nacional de Córdoba**, Córdoba, Argentina  
Licenciate in Music Composition, May 2012  
Thesis Title: *A Form of Pleasure: Music as an Experience of Pleasure*

# DISSERTATION

**Title**: Database Music: A History, Technology, and Aesthetics of the
Database in Music Composition  
**Advisor**: Jaime Oliver La Rosa  
**Committee**: Elizabeth Hoffman (NYU GSAS) - Martin Daughtry (NYU GSAS)
- William Brent (American University) - Robert Rowe (NYU Steinhardt)  
**Summary**: This dissertation outlines a framework to discuss the
aesthetic agency of the database in music composition. I place my
dissertation in relation to existing scholarship, artists, and
developers working in the fields of music composition, computer science,
affect, and ontology, with emphasis on the ubiquity of databases and on
the need to reflect on their practice, particularly in relation to
databasing and music composition. There is a database everywhere,
anytime, always already affecting our lives; it is an agent in our
aesthetic and political lives just as much as we are agents in its
composition and performance. Database music lives in between computers
and sound. My argument is that in order to conceptualize the agency of
the database in music composition, we need to trace the history of the
practice, in both its technical and its artistic use, so as to find
nodes of action that have an effect on the resulting aesthetics.
