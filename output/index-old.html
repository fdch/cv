<p>Syllabus design and lectures on audio analyisis and machine learning with python for musicological analysis. Co-taught with Dr. Dan Sullivan</p>
</div>
<div class="position">
<p>The objective of the course is to experience live performance with various (primarily virtual) digital sonic instruments and (virtual and physical) hardware controllers in order to understand the role that they can have in creating new forms of (mainly music) performance. To create performances in various sized ensembles to understand the relationships among performing, composing, improvisation, notation, and - yes - computer programming and hardware hacking. To understand the relationships between “traditional” musical instruments and electronically created or enhanced musical instruments. To make us think about how the changing nature of what an “instrument” is affects our conception of music and sound. Co-taught with Dr. Marc Ainger.

<p>This course introduced students to the general theory of digital sound signals, and the techniques to synthesize and transform them. Some topics included: sampling theorem and sine waves, samples, reading/writing arrays, additive synthesis, filters and subtractive synthesis, among others. I gave lectures on video and graphics in GEM, graded homeworks, and assisted students throughout the course, but mostly during their final projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="position">
<p>Focused on practical, technical and collaborative work, this course introduced students to polyphonic music thinking and writing, from a composer’s perspective. I designed the syllabus, gave lectures, graded, and worked with a Teaching Assistant who was in charge recitation lessons.</p>
</div>
<div class="position">
<p>This course situated the practice of harmony and counterpoint in a historical context and examined the limits of tonality through a detailed study of chromatic harmony. I was in charge of recitation lessons and graded homework and practical excercises.</p>
</div>
<div class="position">
<p>This course provided basic tools (conceptual and aural) for understanding diatonic (tonal relations within a single key) procedures. It focused primarily on harmony and voice-leading practices in tonal European art music of the common practice period of the 18 th century. I was in charge of recitation lessons and graded homework and practical excercises.</p>

<p>Waverly Project was a platform for presenting the output of composers at NYU in any form. The mission of the project was to present exciting new music from the city, to offer rising artists a NYC premiere, and to forge new, international links between a generation of emerging musicians. The project started in collaboration with NYU composer and colleague Ioannis Angelakis in 2013 and kept on going under different direction and new collaborations with other colleagues throughtout our PhD coursework years until 2017.</p>

<p>Proyecto[Red]Ensamble is a network of musicians, composers, visual artists, dancers, and performers which started in early 2010 in collaboration with UNC composer and colleague Pablo Behm. The project aims to bring to the concert hall (and outside of it) new collaborative and experimental works. It is a non-profit organization offering to forge a diverse, interdisciplinary, and non-hierarchical view of art production in the city of Córdoba, Argentina.</p>
